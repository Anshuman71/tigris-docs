# Getting Started

Tigris provides a fast and scalable way to store, index and search
documents and vector embeddings. It comes with intuitive APIs and
provides a hassle-free infrastructure-less experience.

## 1. Install the client

Ensure that you are on Typescript version 4.5 or above.

```bash
npm install @tigrisdata/core
```

Add the following settings in compilerOptions section of tsconfig.json:

```json
"emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
"experimentalDecorators": true,
```

## 2. Fetch Tigris API credentials

You can sign up for a free Tigris account <a href={tigrisConfig.signupUrl}>here</a>.

Once you have signed up for the Tigris account, create a new project
called `vectorsearchapp`. Next, make a note of the `clientId` and `clientSecret`,
which you can get from the **Application Keys** section of the project.

## 3. Initialize the client

We will use the project name, clientId and clientSecret from the previous step to
initialize the client.

```ts
import {
  Search,
  SearchField,
  SearchQuery,
  Tigris,
  TigrisSearchIndex,
} from "@tigrisdata/core";

const tigrisClient = new Tigris({
  serverUrl: "api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud",
  projectName: "vectorsearchapp",
  clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  clientSecret: "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
  branch: "main",
});
```

The Tigris client can also read the configuration from `.env` file if it exists.

## 4. Create an index

Index is where you store your documents and vector embeddings. An index has a
name and a schema.

```ts
// Define the index schema consisting of the document fields and vector field
@TigrisSearchIndex("reviews")
export class Review {
  @SearchField()
  Id: string;

  @SearchField()
  Text: string;

  // 1536 floats total for ada-002
  @SearchField({ dimensions: 1536 })
  vector: number[];
}

// Create the index
const search = tigrisClient.getSearch();
await search.createOrUpdateIndex(Review);
```

## 5. Add some documents to the index

Assuming you have already generated the vector embeddings, add the documents
with the embeddings to the index.

```ts
await index.createOrReplaceMany([
  {
    Id: "1",
    Text: "This is a great product. I would recommend it to anyone.",
    vector: [1.2, 2.3, 4.5],
  },
  {
    Id: "2",
    Text: "This is a bad product. I would not recommend it to anyone.",
    vector: [6.7, 8.2, 9.2],
  },
]);
```

## 6. Query the index

You can query the index for similar documents now by providing the query vector,
and Tigris will return the `n` most similar documents.

```ts
const request: SearchQuery<Review> = {
  vectorQuery: {
    vector: [1.1, 2.2, 3.3],
  },
  hitsPerPage: 10,
};

index.search(request).then((results) => {
  console.log(results);
});
```

The results are sorted by the vector distance. The vector distance is a measure of
how similar the query is to the documents in the `Review` index. The closer the
vector distance is to 0, the more similar they are.

## Next Steps

- Try the [Vector Search quickstart](../../../quickstarts/quickstart-vector-search)
  that uses the OpenAI Embeddings API to generate embeddings for your documents
  and then use Tigris to index these embeddings for fast and scalable vector search.
- Explore the [Hybrid Search section](../hybrid-search) to learn how to combine
  vector search with attribute filtering for more relevant search results.
- Explore the [TypeScript SDK search modeling section](../../../sdkstools/typescript/search/datamodel/)
  to learn more about defining the index schema.

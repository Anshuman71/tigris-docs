# MongoDB Compatibility (beta)

import tigrisConfig from "@site/tigris.config.js";

Tigris MongoDB compatibility enables you to plan the migration of your
data-driven applications over to Tigris. You can begin by updating your
connection string to connect to Tigris instead of MongoDB Atlas. Then, update
your application functionality to take advantage of additional Tigris
functionality according to your roadmap.

**The first beta release of Tigris MongoDB compatibility offers MongoDB 6.0+
basic CRUD functionality**. You can communicate with the Tigris using any open source
[MongoDB client drivers](https://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers).
Tigris enables the use of existing client drivers by leveraging the FerretDB library
to adhere to the [MongoDB wire protocol version 6.0](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mongodb-wire-protocol/).

We will add additional functionality based on the
feedback we receive from the <a href={tigrisConfig.discordUrl}>Tigris
community</a>.

:::info Connection string
To connect to Tigris using MongoDB compatibility, the connection string should
be in the following format:

```
mongodb://{TIGRIS_CLIENT_ID}:{TIGRIS_CLIENT_SECRET}@m1k.preview.tigrisdata.cloud:27018?authMechanism=PLAIN&tls=true
```

Create a Project in <a href={tigrisConfig.signupUrl}>Tigris Cloud</a> and get a Client ID and Client Secret from the Project's Application Keys.
Replace `TIGRIS_CLIENT_ID` with a Tigris Client ID and `TIGRIS_CLIENT_SECRET`
with a Client Secret in the above connection string.

## Tigris vs. MongoDB Atlas benefits

Tigris has several crucial benefits when compared to MongoDB Atlas:

- **Cloud-native architecture**: Tigris follows a modern composable architecture
  with loosely coupled components. Furthermore, compute is separated from
  storage, allowing for independent scaling and a more resilient system.
- **Automatic database sharding**: Tigris provides automatic database sharding, and
  shard keys are unnecessary as the data distribution is automatically handled.
  This includes both sharding and optimizing the number of shards. MongoDB Atlas
  requires you to specify and manage sharding to horizontally scale. With Tigris
  you get more time to focus on developing applications for your users.
- **Cost-efficient and unlimited scalability**: Unlike MongoDB Atlas, Tigris can
  scale to millions of records read and written per second and petabytes of data
  storage at a fraction of the cost.
- **Bring your own cloud**: Tigris' open source Kubernetes-native design allows it
  to be deployed anywhere in the cloud in your own VPC, so that all the data is
  contained in your own environment.
- **Strong data consistency**: The storage layer is built on FoundationDB, and
  Tigris inherits the strong consistency guarantees. Tigris provides global,
  interactive, ACID transactions with strict serializability using optimistic
  concurrency control. Tigris also provides strongly consistent global secondary
  indexes that enable powerful querying capabilities by any field.

## How MongoDB compatibility works

Tigris leverages FerretDB library to provide compatibility with the wire protocol
for MongoDB, which enables transparent compatibility with native MongoDB client SDKs,
drivers, and tools. Tigris doesn't host the MongoDB database engine. Any
MongoDB client driver compatible with version 6.0+ should be able to connect
with no special configuration. We are actively working on testing the
compatibility with all MongoDB drivers.
The [Driver Status section](/docs/concepts/mongodb-compatibility/driver-status)
lists the most up-to-date information.

This article describes a feature of Tigris that provides wire protocol
compatibility with MongoDB databases. Tigris does not run MongoDB databases to
provide this service. Tigris is not affiliated with MongoDB, Inc.

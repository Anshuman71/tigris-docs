# Project

When using Tigris, the first thing to do is to create a project.

Every project on Tigris comes with:

- A [transactional document database](../database/database.md) built on
  [FoundationDB](https://blog.tigrisdata.com/building-a-database-using-foundationdb).
- A serverless full-text search engine built on
  [TypeSense](https://typesense.org/).
- [Auto-generated APIs](/references/api/) to interact with Tigris easily over
  HTTP.
- And more to be released soon.

Visit the <a href={tigrisConfig.loginUrl}>Tigris Cloud console</a> and sign in
to start creating projects.

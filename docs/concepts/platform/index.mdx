# Tigris Platform

Tigris is an Open Source Developer Data Platform that provides a cloud-native,
cost-efficient alternative to MongoDB Atlas.

Select either a self-hosted, or a cloud deployment option where we provide a
hosted version of the platform which makes it very simple to get started without
needing to manage any infrastructure.

# What is Tigris?

Modern cloud-native applications are often built using multiple databases
and data infrastructure components - from search, to document stores, to
messaging systems. Each of these components will have different access
patterns, use different data models, have specialized APIs or query
languages, and require constant tuning and optimization. Each of
these components also need to be set up, managed, and maintained using
different skill sets.

**This diverse and complex data infrastructure comes at a significant cost to
the developers and forces them to spend their time on infrastructure
management instead of building their applications.**

**[Tigris](https://github.com/tigrisdata/tigris) changes this development
paradigm! Tigris combines the most commonly used components and data
services in an open source developer data platform, supporting multiple data
models and data access patterns.**

With a single, unified HTTP API that spans
search, indexing, event streaming, and transactional document store,
developers can focus on building their applications and stop worrying about
the data infrastructure.

## Eliminate complexity and speed up development

### 1. De-clutter developer’s minds: Less time messing with data, more time building cool apps

Tigris combines all your data into a single system creating a rich user
experience. Spend less time troubleshooting, learning new database languages,
and maintaining complicated systems. Speed up development and focus on what
you do best with Tigris’s unified API that combines storage, query, search,
and streaming.

### 2. Power your mission critical applications: Reliability without operations management

With its self-managing, infrastructureless design, Tigris is built to
scale. It comes with built-in distributed fault tolerance and automated data
recovery, so you can feel confident using our platform to run your most
crucial applications.

### 3. Automatic Indexing: No need to continuously tune and optimize your data model and queries

Forget query tuning. Automatic index management and maintenance are built
right in. Enjoy accelerated queries and instantly search through all your
data in real time.

### 4. Flexibility without complexity: Customizable structures for all your data needs

Never feel limited by your database again. Schema changes are as simple and
painless as regular feature development and our flexible document model is
built to handle a wide variety of use cases while also allowing for the
storage of an infinite number of data models.

### 5. Built for scale: Cloud-native architecture with components that scale independently

Scale your applications faster without infrastructure to manage. Tigris is
built employing a cloud-native, decoupled architecture with individual
components that can be scaled independently to keep performance and
scalability high while keeping costs low.

## Where to go from here?

You have made it to the end of this page. We hope you are as excited as we are
about eliminating data infrastructure complexity and simplifying development
of data-driven applications.

Next, we recommend following the [Quick Start](../quickstart/quickstart.mdx)
guide. It gives you a taste of the development workflow with Tigris and takes
only around 5-10 minutes to complete.

After completing the quickstart, we recommend browsing through the docs in your
own areas of interest, or join our
[Slack Community](https://join.slack.com/t/tigrisdatacommunity/shared_invite/zt-16fn5ogio-OjxJlgttJIV0ZDywcBItJQ)
to ask any questions you might have.

Finally, we recommend you to [signup](https://www.tigrisdata.com/beta) for the
private beta of Tigris Cloud and preview the developer data platform.

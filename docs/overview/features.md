# Features

Tigris is the all-in-one open source developer data platform. With a unified
serverless API that spans search, event streaming, and transactional
document store, along with smart features like automatic indexing,
developers can work with their data without all the tedious infrastructure
management.

- 🪗 **Flexible Document Model**
  - Supports a wide variety of applications.
  - JSON-like structure makes it easy to map to the objects in your code.
  - Schema changes are performed in a lightweight manner without any
    downtime and do not require a collection rebuild.
- 🏝 **Simple APIs**
  - Quickly add data and easily retrieve or edit that data through simple
    and intuitive APIs.
  - Continue using your preferred programming language, there is no new
    database query language to learn.
- 🏦 **Transactions**
  - Transactions that work across collections and documents without any
    restrictions.
  - Strictly serializable isolation by default. Unlike some
    other document databases, there are no confusing read / write concerns to
    configure, and no cross-shard caveats.
- 🤖 **Automatic Index Maintenance & Management**
  - Easily query all your data without any database administration overhead.
  - The system makes query tuning a thing of the past with automatic index
    management and maintenance, meaning you will never have to worry about
    slow queries due to missing indexes.
- 🔀 **Event Streaming**
  - Stream events directly from your apps, services, or IOT devices.
  - Since data is automatically indexed, you can query all data and search
    through all events with ease.
- 🔍 **Real-time Search**
  - Search across all your collections at once using full text or faceted
    search.
  - Create rich user experiences with an integrated search engine
    that eliminates the need to run a separate search platform and
    synchronize data.
- 💚 **Open Source**
  - Tigris is truly open source, adhering to an Apache 2 license.
  - We continuously build to improve performance, reliability and
    flexibility of the platform.
- 🔒 **Data Sovereignty**
  - Keep control of your data.
  - Deploy Tigris on your own infrastructure whether on-prem or in the cloud
    and keep your data safe and secure. Perfect for ensuring compliance with
    all regulatory requirements.

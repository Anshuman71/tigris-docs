# Quickstart: Vector search with OpenAI and Tigris

In this guide, we'll show you how to use the OpenAI Embeddings API to generate
embeddings for your documents and then use Tigris to index these embeddings
for fast and scalable vector search.

This is a powerful combination that can be used for building semantic search
applications, recommendation engines, and more.

## Vector search workflow with OpenAI and Tigris

The vector search workflow with OpenAI and Tigris works as follows:

1. Generate embeddings for your documents using the OpenAI Embeddings API.
2. Index the embeddings in Tigris.
3. Pass the search query through the OpenAI Embeddings API to generate an
   embedding.
4. Use the embedding to search for similar documents in Tigris.
5. Get back semantically similar documents, even if they don't contain the
   search query keywords.

Now, let's build a vector search application that implements this workflow.

## Building the vector search application

To follow along with this guide, you'll need:

- An OpenAI account. You can sign up for an account [here](https://platform.openai.com/)
- A Tigris Cloud account. You can sign up for a free account <a href={tigrisConfig.signupUrl}>here</a>
- [Node.js 18.13.0](https://nodejs.org/) or newer

Once you have signed up for the Tigris Cloud account, create a new project called `vectorsearchapp`.
Next, make a note of the `clientId` and `clientSecret`, which you can get from the **Application Keys**
section of the project.

### Bootstrap the application

Tigris provides a tool called `create-tigris-app` that you can use to quickly bootstrap a new Node.js
application. We will use this tool to create an application with Tigris and OpenAI clients already
configured.

```bash
npx create-tigris-app@latest --project vectorsearchapp --example vector-search-openai
```

<details>
<summary>Command output</summary>

```bash
‚úî What is the clientId? ‚Ä¶ client_id_here
‚úî What is the clientSecret? ‚Ä¶ *******************************************************
Creating a new app in /Users/ovaistariq/projects/vectorsearchapp.

Downloading files for example vector-search-openai. This might take a moment.


Initializing project with template: vector-search-openai

Using npm.

Installing dependencies:
- @tigrisdata/vector: latest
- csv-parse: ^5.3.6
- dotenv: ^16.0.3
- express: 4.18.2
- openai: ^3.2.1
- reflect-metadata: ^0.1.13
- zod: ^3.19.1

  run `npm fund` for details

Initialized a git repository.


Success! Created vectorsearchapp at /Users/ovaistariq/projects/vectorsearchapp

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm run dev
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Builds the app for production.

  npm start
    Runs the built app in production mode.

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd vectorsearchapp
  npm run dev

```

</details>

The `create-tigris-app` tool will create a new directory called `vectorsearchapp`. Let's
change into this directory.

```bash
cd vectorsearchapp
```

We will need the OpenAI Organization ID and API key to authenticate with OpenAI.
Visit the [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) page to retrieve the API key
and the [Org Settings](https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings) page to retrieve
the Organization ID.

Then update the `.env` file with the OpenAI Organization ID and API key.

```bash
OPENAI_ORG=your_org_id_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Now we are all set.

Next, we will demonstrate how simple it is to store the embeddings in Tigris and then use
the Tigris client to search for similar documents. We will use a subset of reviews from the
[Amazon fine-food reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews) dataset.

### Generating embeddings with OpenAI

Let's run the following command to generate embeddings for the reviews and store the
reviews and embeddings in Tigris.

```bash
npm run seed
```

The command performs the following steps:

1. Creates a Tigris Search Index
2. Reads the reviews from a CSV file AND generates embeddings via OpenAI
3. Store reviews and embeddings in Tigris

Now that the embeddings have been generated and stored in Tigris, we can start the application
and perform searches.

## Running the vector search application

Let's run the following command to start the application in development mode running on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
npm run dev
```

</details>

### Searching for similar reviews

Let's perform some searches now.

```bash
curl \
  'http://localhost:3000/search?searchString=dog&k=10' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

This returns the following results:

We have searched for "dog" and the results are sorted by the vector distance. The
vector distance is a measure of how similar the search string is to the review text. The
closer the vector distance is to 0, the more similar the review text is to the search
string.

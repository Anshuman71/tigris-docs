# .NET MongoDB compatibility quickstart

This quickstart will get you up and running with an application that
demonstrates Tigris MongoDB compatibility.

You can view the
[source for the .NET MongoDB compatibility quickstart app](https://github.com/tigrisdata-community/tigris-mongodb-dotnet-example)
on GitHub.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/)
- A [Tigris Cloud account](https://console.preview.tigrisdata.cloud/signup)

## Get the code

Clone the repo, navigate into the directories, and install the application
dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tigrisdata-community/tigris-mongodb-dotnet-example.git
cd tigris-mongodb-dotnet-example
```

1. Create a project in Tigris.
1. Create an application key, and copy the Project name, Client ID, and Client
   Secret values.
1. Edit appsettings.json and appsettings.Development.json to add your
   `{TIGRIS_CLIENT_ID}`, `{TIGRIS_CLIENT_SECRET}`, `{TIGRIS_PROJECT_NAME}`, and
   `{TIGRIS_COLLECTION_NAME}`.
1. Run the project to allow you access to the endpoints for all CRUD operations.

## Run the app

Start the app as follows:

```shell
dotnet run
```

Create a new Game:

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:5000/api/games' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
   "name": "Fable Anniversary",
   "price": 4.99,
   "category": "Video Game"
}'
```

List Games:

```shell
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:5000/api/games'
```

Get a single Game:

```shell
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:5000/api/games/{_id}'
```

Delete a Game:

```shell
curl --location --request DELETE 'http://localhost:5000/api/games/{_id}'
```

## Getting to know the code

The below diagram shows the overall architecture of the diagram and the
following sections will explain the code:

![Architecture diagram of the application](./diagram.png)

### Controllers

The GamesController.cs class is where the routes/endpoints for the api are
defined.

Each endpoint calls to a method in the GamesService.cs class.

### Services

The GamesService.cs class contains the code that uses the MongoDB.Driver NuGet
package to carry out CRUD operations against your Tigris project.

### Models

The Game.cs class acts as a model you can use throughout the project and the
properties in it, map to the fields in the document.

GamesDatabaseSettings.cs contains an interface and implementation that maps to
the GamesDatabaseSettings section in appsettings.json and
appsettings.Development.json. In this application, the connection string is
stored here, but normally in production, you would combine this with
[user secrets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=windows).

### Project Root

At the root of the project is the usual files that come out of the box with an
ASP.NET Core Web API project.

The only file with changes made here is the Startup.cs class. Inside the
ConfigureServices method, the appsettings code is pulled in and the Database
settings and Games Service are added to dependency injection for use in other
classes.

Tigris offers a realtime search for events in a topic. Searching is by default enabled for a
topic, there is no setup. This guide section will walk through how to use Tigris search in
different scenarios.

<div>{props.loadOverview && <SearchOverview />}</div>

### Example collection

As we have seen in document store examples an e-commerce website collection catalog. Now, let's say you want to have an
order topic where an event is fired when an order is placed. The first step is to set up this topic object.

<AsyncCodeBlock
  codeLang={props.codeLang}
  defaultExample={props.createCollection}
  asyncExample={props.asyncCreateCollection}
/>

Now, let's assume the above topic has 5 orders(events) in it.

| orderId | name           | brand        | status     | metadata                                               |
| ------- | -------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1       | fiona handbag  | michael kors | "sold"     | {"color": "black", "account": "jane", "quantity": 8}   |
| 2       | tote bag       | coach        | "sold"     | {"color": "olivia", "account": "mark", "quantity": 50} |
| 3       | sling bag      | coach        | "canceled" | {"color": "alice", "account": "jane", "quantity": 15}  |
| 4       | sneakers shoes | adidas       | "pending"  | {"color": "olivia", "account": "john", "quantity": 5}  |
| 5       | running shoes  | nike         | "canceled" | {"color": "olivia", "account": "alex", "quantity": 25} |

## Searching for events

Search consists of executing a query against one or more text fields. Let's perform a simple search query to
lookup any items matching "running".

<AsyncCodeBlock
  codeLang={props.codeLang}
  defaultExample={props.simpleSearch}
  asyncExample={props.asyncSimpleSearch}
/>

:::info
Search is **case-insensitive** i.e. a search for term `"ruNninG"` would match all of `["Running", "running", "RUnnIng", "RUNNING"]` etc.
:::

### Phrase search

By default, search is performed over individual terms in the text. For example, search for a
query string `adventure park` in a dataset would yield following results:

1. "California's kids **adventure park** and Safari"
2. "**Adventure** island and water **park**"
3. "Long Island water **park** and **adventure** activities"
4. "Six flags kids recreation and **adventure park**"
5. "Hollywood **adventure park** and studios"
6. "Seaworld **adventure** and theme **park**"

The search phrase can be _escaped_ in query for exact match. In the above example, querying for exact
phrase `\"adventure park\"` would return:

1. "California's kids **adventure park** and Safari"
2. "Six flags kids recreation and **adventure park**"
3. "The Great America **adventure park** and Zoo"

Phrases can still be combined with keywords for richer text search. Continuing above example,
the query string `kids \"adventure park\"` would result in:

1. "California's **kids adventure park** and Safari"
2. "Six flags **kids** recreation and **adventure park**"

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.phraseSearch}</CodeBlock>

### Match all search query

When query string isn't specified or an empty string (`""`), a match all query is performed.
It returns all searchable events, modified by any filters or search parameters used.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.matchAllSearch}</CodeBlock>

:::tip
Returning all events is typically useful when used in conjunction with **filter**, or when
performing a faceted search across the collection.
:::

## Project search query against specific fields

We can optionally project the search query against selected fields. Continuing previous example of
searching for "running", we may not want to search in `status` or `brand` field and avoid any
unwanted results.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.searchFields}</CodeBlock>

## Refine the search results using filters

Let's adjust the query to only return events that are "sold". We can use
[filters](query#filter) in search to further refine the results.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.searchFilters}</CodeBlock>

### Exact text match

Filters can be used to match against one or more field values in a topic. For example, to
fetch all events from `brand` "adidas".

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.exactMatch}</CodeBlock>

## Faceted search

You can additionally retrieve the number of items a particular `brand` has
that match our search query.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.facetedSearch}</CodeBlock>

Facets are a specific use-case of filters, and can only be used for filterable attributes.

:::tip Faceted content navigation UI
Common application for faceted search is to build UX with quick filters, that users can use
to narrow search results in real-time. Faceted search interface presents intuitive content
navigation to the end user.
:::

## Sorting the search results

Tigris lets you specify an order to sort the search results. You can specify a ranking order in your
search query to have results sorted with more popular items appearing first.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.sortedSearch}</CodeBlock>

Many events may have the same score, you can specify additional user-defined sortable
field to break the tie.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.multipleSortFields}</CodeBlock>

The results will be first sorted by value of `metadata.quantity` field, `metadata.color` will be used to
decide ordering if two matching documents have same `quantity`.

:::note
Events can only be sorted by `integer`, `number` and `date-time` type of fields.
:::

## Specifying event fields to retrieve

Search query can be programmed to return only specific fields in an event in search results. You
may only need to retrieve `name`, `brand` and `status` for your use-case.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.includeFields}</CodeBlock>

On the contrary, exclusion of fields is useful to exclude/hide potentially sensitive fields or
internal metadata from the document. To include all fields except `id` and `metadata` from events
in search results.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.excludeFields}</CodeBlock>

:::note
Field selection does not impact searching, filtering and faceting capabilities for that field. For
example, if `metadata` field is not included in search results, it could still be used
for text querying, filtering and/or faceting; just that matched events won't include `metadata`
field.
:::

## Case-Insensitive Search Result Filtering

Search is **case-insensitive** but the filtering to restrict the search result is **case-sensitive** by default. Tigris supports
Collation which allows you to specify string comparison rules for filtering on text fields. Set the case to `ci` in the
collation object to make it **case-insensitive**. The following example is showing when you are searching for text "running"
and you need to filter by `brand` field, but you don't care about the case.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.searchUsingCollation}</CodeBlock>

Tigris offers a realtime search for documents in a collection. Searching is by default enabled for a
collection, there is no setup. This guide section will walk through how to use Tigris search in
different scenarios.

### Example collection

Assuming an e-commerce website that has a collection catalog and has 6 products(documents) in it.

| id  | name           | price | brand        | labels   | popularity | reviews                             |
| --- | -------------- | ----- | ------------ | -------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1   | fiona handbag  | 99.9  | michael kors | purses   | 8          | {"author": "alice", "rating": 7}    |
| 2   | tote bag       | 49    | coach        | handbags | 9          | {"author": "olivia", "rating": 8.3} |
| 3   | sling bag      | 75    | coach        | purses   | 9          | {"author": "alice", "rating": 9.2}  |
| 4   | sneakers shoes | 40    | adidas       | shoes    | 10         | {"author": "olivia", "rating": 9}   |
| 5   | running shoes  | 89    | nike         | shoes    | 10         | {"author": "olivia", "rating": 8.5} |
| 6   | running shorts | 35    | adidas       | clothing | 7          | {"author": "olivia", "rating": 7.5} |

Let's first have the collection.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.createCollection}</CodeBlock>

## Searching for documents

Search consists for a query against one or more text fields. Let's perform a simple search query to
lookup any items matching "running".

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.searchForDocuments}</CodeBlock>

### Match all search query

When query string isn't specified or an empty string (`""`), a match all query is performed.
It returns all searchable documents, modified by any filters or search parameters used.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.matchAllSearch}</CodeBlock>

:::tip
Returning all documents is typically useful when used in conjunction with **filter**, or when
performing a faceted search across the collection.
:::

## Project search query against specific fields

We can optionally project the search query against selected fields. Continuing previous example of
searching for "running", we may not want to search in `reviews` field and avoid any
unwanted results.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.searchFields}</CodeBlock>

## Refine the search results using filters

Let's adjust the query to only return items in `price` range of **[40, 90)**. We can use
[filters](query#filter) in search to further refine the results.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.searchFilters}</CodeBlock>

### Exact text match

Filters can be used to match against one or more field values in a collection. For example, to
fetch all items from `brand` "adidas".

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.exactMatch}</CodeBlock>

## Faceted search

We can additionally retrieve the number of items a particular `brand` has and unique `labels`,
that match our search query.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.facetedSearch}</CodeBlock>

Facets are a specific use-case of filters, and can only be used for filterable attributes.

:::tip Faceted content navigation UI
Common application for faceted search is to build UX with quick filters, that users can use
to narrow search results in real-time. Faceted search interface presents intuitive content
navigation to the end user.
:::

## Specifying document fields to retrieve

Search query can be programmed to return only specific fields in a document in search results. We
may only need to retrieve product `name`, `brand` and `price` for our interface.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.includeFields}</CodeBlock>

On the contrary, exclusion of fields is useful to exclude/hide potentially sensitive fields or
internal metadata from the document. To include all fields except `id` and `reviews` from documents
in search results.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.excludeFields}</CodeBlock>

:::note
Field selection does not impact searching, filtering and faceting capabilities for that field. For
example, if `reviews` field is not included in documents in search results, it could still be used
for text querying, filtering and/or faceting; just that matched documents won't include `reviews`
field.

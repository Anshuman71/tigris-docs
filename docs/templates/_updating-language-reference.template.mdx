import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

Tigris enables you to quickly add data and easily retrieve or edit that data through simple and
intuitive APIs. The first step is to set up the collection object. All the CRUD operations on
the collection are performed through this collection object.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.createCollection}</CodeBlock>

## Update documents

The Update API is used to update existing documents that match the filters.
Fields that need to be updated are specified when calling the API.

In the following example, the field **balance** is updated for documents which
match the filter `id = 1`.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.simpleUpdate}</CodeBlock>

import UpdateSpecs from "./_update-specs.template.mdx";
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import { AsyncCodeBlock } from "./commons";

The Update API is used to update existing documents that match the filters.
Fields that need to be updated are specified when calling the API.

<div>{props.loadOverview && <UpdateSpecs />}</div>

### Example collection

The first step is to set up the collection object. All the operations on
the collection is performed through this collection object.

<AsyncCodeBlock
  codeLang={props.codeLang}
  defaultExample={props.createCollection}
  asyncExample={props.asyncCreateCollection}
/>

Now let's assume an e-commerce website that has the above collection catalog and has 5 products(documents) present in it.

| id  | name           | price | brand        | labels   | popularity | reviews                             |
| --- | -------------- | ----- | ------------ | -------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1   | fiona handbag  | 99.9  | michael kors | purses   | 8          | {"author": "alice", "rating": 7}    |
| 2   | tote bag       | 49    | coach        | handbags | 9          | {"author": "olivia", "rating": 8.3} |
| 3   | sling bag      | 75    | coach        | purses   | 9          | {"author": "alice", "rating": 9.2}  |
| 4   | sneakers shoes | 40    | adidas       | shoes    | 10         | {"author": "olivia", "rating": 9}   |
| 5   | running shoes  | 89    | nike         | shoes    | 10         | {"author": "olivia", "rating": 8.5} |

### Simple Update

A simple update is by updating a document that matches the id which is the primary key of this collection.
In the above collection, let's say there is a need to modify the `price` of a product that has an id assigned as **1**.

<AsyncCodeBlock
  codeLang={props.codeLang}
  defaultExample={props.simpleUpdate}
  asyncExample={props.asyncSimpleUpdate}
/>

### Updates using logical OR

A single update is shown in the above example but there could be a need to update multiple products by
their primary key. A logical `OR` filter is one of the ways of updating multiple documents. The example below is
updating the `popularity` score for two documents that have id **1** or **4**.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.orUpdate}</CodeBlock>

### Range update

Extending the example, what if there is a need to reset the `popularity` score of a few products but these product ids
are continuous? In this case, a range update can be performed on this field. The following example is applying
range update on the id field.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.rangeUpdate}</CodeBlock>

## Filtering on multiple fields

There may be cases when you don't know the primary key value and instead wants to update a document by applying a
condition on the non-primary key field. The following example is increasing the `price` of a product when the name
and brand match with the documents present in the collection.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.updateNonPK}</CodeBlock>

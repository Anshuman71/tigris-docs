Tigris provides powerful query functionality for specifying which events you want to retrieve. There is no need to
index any field as Tigris allows querying on any field of an event.

## Filter

Filter provides the following comparison operators with the same semantics as in virtually all programming languages.

- <b>{props.filters["eq"]}</b>: equal to is used for exact matching.
- <b>{props.filters["lt"]}</b>: less than is used for matching documents using
  less than criteria.
- <b>{props.filters["lte"]}</b>: less than or equal to is similar to <b>
    {props.filters["lt"]}
  </b> but also matches for equality.
- <b>{props.filters["gt"]}</b>: greater than is used for matching documents
  using greater than criteria.
- <b>{props.filters["gte"]}</b>: greater than or equal to is similar to <b>
    {props.filters["gt"]}
  </b> but also matches for equality.

For multiple conditions, there are two logical operators supported.

- <b>{props.filters["or"]}</b>: Combines multiple filter operators and returns
  documents when either condition is met.
- <b>{props.filters["and"]}</b>: Combines multiple filter operators and returns
  documents when all the conditions are met.

## Example Topic

As we have seen in document store examples an e-commerce website collection catalog. Now, let's say you want to have an
order topic where an event is fired when an order is placed. The first step is to set up this topic object.

<AsyncCodeBlock
  codeLang={props.codeLang}
  defaultExample={props.createCollection}
  asyncExample={props.asyncCreateCollection}
/>

Now, let's assume the above topic has 5 orders(events) in it.

| orderId | name           | brand        | status     | metadata                                               |
| ------- | -------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1       | fiona handbag  | michael kors | "sold"     | {"color": "black", "account": "jane", "quantity": 8}   |
| 2       | tote bag       | coach        | "sold"     | {"color": "olivia", "account": "mark", "quantity": 50} |
| 3       | sling bag      | coach        | "canceled" | {"color": "alice", "account": "jane", "quantity": 15}  |
| 4       | sneakers shoes | adidas       | "pending"  | {"color": "olivia", "account": "john", "quantity": 5}  |
| 5       | running shoes  | nike         | "canceled" | {"color": "olivia", "account": "alex", "quantity": 25} |

## Query on all the Events

### Simple read query

A straightforward query is to read events by applying a filter on a field. As an example, applying the filter on the
above collection by reading only the orders that are of `brand` "adidas".

<AsyncCodeBlock
  codeLang={props.codeLang}
  defaultExample={props.readOne}
  asyncExample={props.asyncReadOne}
/>

:::note
String comparison is case sensitive.
:::

### Filtering on multiple fields

Single field filtering is useful but what if you need to also filter by `status`. Following is an example where we are
reading all the orders where `brand` is "coach" and `status` is "sold".

<AsyncCodeBlock
  codeLang={props.codeLang}
  defaultExample={props.multipleFields}
  asyncExample={props.asyncMultipleFields}
/>

### Reading specific fields

Instead of reading all the fields of an event, fields projection allows reading specific fields. As an above example,
let's say you only need to read `name`, `brand` and `status` fields from an event.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.readFields}</CodeBlock>

:::note
To exclude use excludeField("fieldName").
:::

### Querying nested fields

As we can see all the above examples are for top level fields but what if you have an object, and you want to filter
events based on one of the nested field. Taking the above data, if you want to get all the orders which is bought by
`account` "jane".

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.nestedFields}</CodeBlock>

### Applying range conditions

Many times the need for filtering is based on range on a numeric field. A range can be applied to any numeric field and
in fact multiple numeric fields can be part of a single filter. Letâ€™s take an example of reading all the products that
are "sold" and have `quantity` less than or equal to 10.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.rangeRead}</CodeBlock>

## Query on Events by Timestamp

Tigris automatically generates timestamp of the event when it is published.

- **created_at:** Time when the event was published to the topic.

This timestamp can be used to narrow down the results. You can use any filter from above and extend it with a timestamp
filter.

For example, to read all events published within a 24-hour period:

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.metadataFilter}</CodeBlock>

### Filter on a timestamp and a field

Let say, you want to read events that are "sold" but are published after "2022-01-01T17:29:28.000Z".

<AsyncCodeBlock
  codeLang={props.codeLang}
  defaultExample={props.timestampAndStatus}
  asyncExample={props.asyncTimestampAndStatus}
/>

:::note
String comparison is case sensitive.

## Case-Insensitive Queries

Tigris supports Collation which allows you to specify string comparison rules. Default is **case-sensitive** filtering on
text fields. But if you need to ignore the case then set the case to `ci` in the collation object. The following example is
showing when you need to query for a `brand` "adidas", but you don't care about the case.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.readUsingCollation}</CodeBlock>

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

Tigris enables you to quickly add data and easily retrieve or edit that data through simple and
intuitive APIs. The first step is to set up the collection object. All the CRUD operations on
the collection are performed through this collection object.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.createCollection}</CodeBlock>

## Delete documents

The Delete API is used to delete existing documents that match the filters.

In the following example, the field **balance** is updated for documents which
match the filter `id = 1`.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.simpleDelete}</CodeBlock>

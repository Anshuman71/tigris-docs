Delete API is used to delete existing documents that match the filters.

<div>{props.loadOverview && <DeleteSpecs />}</div>

### Example collection

The first step is to set up the collection object. All the operations on
the collection are performed through this collection object.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.createCollection}</CodeBlock>

Now let's assume an e-commerce website that has the above collection catalog and has 5 products(documents) present in it.

| id  | name           | price | brand        | labels   | popularity | reviews                             |
| --- | -------------- | ----- | ------------ | -------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1   | fiona handbag  | 99.9  | michael kors | purses   | 8          | {"author": "alice", "rating": 7}    |
| 2   | tote bag       | 49    | coach        | handbags | 9          | {"author": "olivia", "rating": 8.3} |
| 3   | sling bag      | 75    | coach        | purses   | 9          | {"author": "alice", "rating": 9.2}  |
| 4   | sneakers shoes | 40    | adidas       | shoes    | 10         | {"author": "olivia", "rating": 9}   |
| 5   | running shoes  | 89    | nike         | shoes    | 10         | {"author": "olivia", "rating": 8.5} |

### Simple Delete

A simple delete is by filtering on the primary key of the document. Let's say you need to remove a product
from this collection that has an `id` assigned as **5**.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.simpleDelete}</CodeBlock>

### Range Delete

Extending the above example, in case the products that you are planning to remove have continuous ids then you can
use range delete to remove these products. As an example, if you need to delete documents that have `id` greater
than or equal to **3** but less than **5**.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.rangeDelete}</CodeBlock>

### Delete All

Sometimes, there is a need to delete all the documents then an empty filter can be sent to the server.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.deleteAll}</CodeBlock>

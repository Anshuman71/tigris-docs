Tigris enables you to quickly add data and easily retrieve or edit that data through simple and
intuitive APIs. The first step is to set up the collection object. All the CRUD operations on
the collection are performed through this collection object.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.createCollection}</CodeBlock>

## Insert documents

Insert API can be used to insert one or more documents into the collection. Since the `id` field
us marked as **autogenerated** field, we don't need to specify value for it and let Tigris generate
the value.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.simpleInsert}</CodeBlock>

The insert API maintains uniqueness of the field marked as primary key, for example, the field `id`
in the example above. If the document with same primary key value already exists in collection, the
operation will fail.

## Upsert documents

Insert or replace operation can be used insert a new document or replace an existing document with
same primary key value.

<CodeBlock language={props.codeLang}>{props.simpleUpsert}</CodeBlock>

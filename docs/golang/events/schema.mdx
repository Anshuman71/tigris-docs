# Schema

A schema defines the structure of the events in a topic. All events published in a topic must conform to the schema.

## Schema Validation

The validation happens during the publishing of the events.

## Modifying the Schema

After creating the topic, you can update the schema at any time. For example, in the previous ProductEvents model you
need to add a `metadata` field to store other information. This can be achieved by just calling `createOrUpdateTopic`
with the updated model.

### Step 1: Update the Model

Add the new field in your model.

```go
type Metadata struct {
    Color  string
    Account string
	Quantity int32
}

type ProductEvents struct {
	OrderId    int64
	Name       string
	Status     string
	Metadata   Metadata
}
```

### Step 2: Update the Topic

Updates the topic with the new model and any new operation will see the changes.

```go
err := db.CreateTopics(ctx, &ProductEvents{})
```

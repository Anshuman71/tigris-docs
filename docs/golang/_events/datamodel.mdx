# Data Modeling

Tigris enables the data models to be declared as part of the
application code. These data models are then converted to appropriate
objects, such as collections, on the backend.

## Declaring Models

Models are regular Go structs composed of basic Go types or custom types.
Field properties can be modified using optional "tigris" tag.

```go
type ProductEvents struct {
	OrderId    int64
	Name       string
	Status     string
}
```

### Create the Topic

Creates the collection with the model and any new operation will see the changes.

```go
err := db.CreateTopics(ctx, &ProductEvents{})
```

# Quickstart: HTTP

The following guide will get you up and running with Tigris. It covers
data modeling, creating database and collection, writing queries to read and
write data, and performing search all without touching any infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

All you'll need is any computer running macOS or Linux.

## Quickstart

### Fetch auth token

We will have to fetch the auth token first. For all the subsequent API calls we
will be using this token.

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud/v1/auth/token \
  --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data grant_type=client_credentials \
  --data client_id=your_client_id_here \
  --data client_secret=your_client_secret_here
```

Use the clientID and clientSecret from the output of the
`tigris create application` command above.

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```json
{ "access_token": "your_token_here", "expires_in": 41437 }
```

</details>

We will be using the token in all the subsequent API calls.

### Creating database and collection

For this quickstart we will create a database named _sampledb_ and then
create a collection _users_ inside it.

Creating a database is as easy as calling an API, and it is ready in an
instant.

```shell
curl https://api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud/v1/databases/sampledb/create \
      -X POST \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here"
```

Similarly, a collection is instantaneously created through the API. In
Tigris, a collection is an ordered set of records called documents that all
follow a specific schema and whose fields are strongly typed.

```shell
curl https://api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud/v1/databases/sampledb/collections/users/createOrUpdate \
      -X POST \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "schema": {
          "title": "users",
          "properties": {
            "balance": {
              "type": "number"
            },
            "id": {
              "type": "integer",
              "format": "int32",
              "autoGenerate": true
            },
            "name": {
              "type": "string"
            }
          },
          "primary_key": [
            "id"
          ]
        }
      }'
```

The schema of the collections created above can be fetched as follows

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud/v1/databases/sampledb/collections/users/describe \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here"
```

### Insert some documents

The following example will replace documents with the same `id` if they
already exist, or create new documents if they don't exist with the same `id`.

```shell
curl https://api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud/v1/databases/sampledb/collections/users/documents/insert \
      -X POST \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "documents": [
          {"name": "Jania McGrory", "balance": 6045.7},
          {"name": "Bunny Instone", "balance": 2948.87}
        ]
      }'
```

### Read a document using the primary key field

Read the document from the collection by using its `id`.

```shell
curl https://api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud/v1/databases/sampledb/collections/users/documents/read \
      -X POST \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "filter": {"id": 1}
      }'
```

### Read a document using any field in the schema

Read the document from the collection by using the field `name`.

```shell
curl https://api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud/v1/databases/sampledb/collections/users/documents/read \
      -X POST \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "filter": {"name": "Jania McGrory"}
      }'
```

### Update a document

Update one of the fields in a document by using its `id`.

```shell
curl https://api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud/v1/databases/sampledb/collections/users/documents/update \
      -X PUT \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "fields": {
          "$set": {"balance": 2448.87}
        },
        "filter": {"id": 2}
      }'
```

### Search

Search for users with `name` like "bunny" and `balance` greater than 500

```shell
curl https://api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud/v1/databases/sampledb/collections/users/documents/search \
      -X POST \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "q": "bunny",
        "search_fields": ["name"],
        "filter": {"balance": {"$gt": 500}}
      }'
```

### Delete documents

Use the delete API to remove the documents from the collection
based on the filter.

```shell
curl https://api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud/v1/databases/sampledb/collections/users/documents/delete \
      -X DELETE \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "filter": {
          "$or": [
            {"id": 1},
            {"id": 2}
          ]
        }
      }'
```

### Drop database

Finally, drop the database _sampledb_ we have created for this quickstart
with all its collections.

```shell
curl -X DELETE https://api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud/v1/databases/sampledb/drop \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here"
```

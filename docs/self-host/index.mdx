Tigris is developed with Kubernetes in mind and is fully containerized. We
expect you to deploy Tigris on Kubernetes in production.

If you are having a hard time installing Tigris yourself, seek help from the
Tigris Community! Consider joining [our Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/tigrisdatacommunity/shared_invite/zt-1hrx3hv78-rw~81EoqxwgiUCURZnWF1g),
or [Discord](http://discord.tigrisdata.com/) and seek assistance there!

The following sections will guide you through setting up Tigris in various
cloud environments. You can self-host Tigris anywhere, as long as Kubernetes is
available.

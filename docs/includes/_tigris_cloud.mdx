</Tabs>

Alternative ways of installation can be found [here](/cli/installation.mdx).

### Sign up for Tigris Cloud

You will need to have a Tigris Cloud account to complete this quickstart. If
you don't already have an account, you can sign up
[here](https://www.tigrisdata.com/beta#signup-form).

### Login and set up the application credentials

Login to your Tigris Cloud account

```shell
tigris login
```

The next step is to generate credentials to be used by the application we
will be building in this quickstart

```shell
tigris create application quickstart "TypeScript quickstart application"
```

Once the command is executed, it would create the application credentials
(clientID and clientSecret) and print it on the screen. Make a note of `id`
and `secret` from the output.

# Authentication & Authorization

Tigris provides pluggable authentication and authorization support. For
authentication Tigris uses [OpenID connect](https://openid.net/connect/)
built on top of OAuth 2.0 and for authorization it uses stateless
[JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/introduction).

Support for customizing the authentication mechanism is also provided. It is
possible to use Google, GitHub, LDAP and other SSO providers.

## Types of users

Tigris has two types of users:

- Human users: This type of user authenticates themselves through the web
  console or the CLI and obtain a JWT.
- Applications: Applications are what you will use to authenticate with
  Tigris via the supported client libraries. Each application has a
  `client_id` and `client_secret` associated with it.

### Creating an application in web console

import LiteYouTubeEmbed from "react-lite-youtube-embed";
import "react-lite-youtube-embed/dist/LiteYouTubeEmbed.css";

<LiteYouTubeEmbed
  id="Ls50EOrU3AQ"
  params="autoplay=1&autohide=1&showinfo=0&rel=0"
  title="Generate application keys for Tigris"
  poster="maxresdefault"
/>

### Authenticating via CLI

See the [CLI/auth](../cli/authentication) section to learn more about
authenticating through the CLI as a regular user and then creating an
application.

## Supported auth providers

### Auth0

Tigris has built in integration with Auth0 as one of the authentication and
authorization providers. Tigris Cloud uses rotating JWT and uses Auth0 as the
signature authority with RS256 signature algorithm.

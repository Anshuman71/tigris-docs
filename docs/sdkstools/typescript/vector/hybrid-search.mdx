# Hybrid Search

Hybrid search is a combination of vector search and attribute filtering.
By specifying expressions that filter on scalar fields you can narrow
down the results of a vector search making them more relevant.

The following example demonstrates how to perform a hybrid search.
Suppose you want to search for product reviews based on vector embeddings,
but you only want those for a certain product category. You can do this
by performing a vector search as usual, but this time also specifying a
filter expression that filters on the product category.

## Create the Vector Database client

```ts
import { VectorDocumentStore } from "@tigrisdata/vector";

const vectorDocStore = new VectorDocumentStore({
  connection: {
    serverUrl: "api.preview.tigrisdata.cloud",
    projectName: "vectordemo",
    clientId: "clientId_here",
    clientSecret: "clientSecret_here",
  },
  indexName: "products",
  numDimensions: 3,
});
```

## Add documents to the index

```ts
await vectorDocStore.addDocumentsWithVectors({
  ids: ["1", "2", "3"],
  embeddings: [
    [1.2, 2.3, 4.5],
    [6.7, 8.2, 9.2],
    [1.0, 2.1, 3.2],
  ],
  documents: [
    {
      content: "This is a great product. I would recommend it to anyone.",
      metadata: {
        ProductCategory: "Electronics",
        Rating: 5,
      },
    },
    {
      content: "This is a bad product. I would not recommend it to anyone.",
      metadata: {
        ProductCategory: "Books",
        Rating: 1,
      },
    },
    {
      content: "This is a good product. I would recommend it to anyone.",
      metadata: {
        ProductCategory: "Electronics",
        Rating: 4,
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

## Perform a hybrid search query

Now we can query the index for similar documents by providing the query
vector. But we will limit the search results to documents that have a
product category of "Electronics".

```ts
const results = await vectorDocStore.similaritySearchVectorWithScore({
  query: [1.1, 2.2, 3.3],
  k: 10,
  filter: {
    "metadata.ProductCategory": "Electronics",
  },
});
console.log(JSON.stringify(results, null, 2));
```

Here the `filter` option is used to specify the attribute filtering
expression. The `filter` option is an object where the keys are the
metadata attributes of the documents and the values are the values
to filter on.

The `filter` option can also be used to filter on multiple attributes.
For example, if you wanted to filter on both the product category and
the rating, you could do the following:

```ts
const results = await vectorDocStore.similaritySearchVectorWithScore({
  query: [1.1, 2.2, 3.3],
  k: 10,
  filter: {
    $and: [
      {
        "metadata.ProductCategory": "Electronics",
      },
      {
        "metadata.Rating": {
          $gt: 4,
        },
      },
    ],
  },
});
console.log(JSON.stringify(results, null, 2));
```

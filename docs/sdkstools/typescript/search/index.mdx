# Search

Tigris enables you to deliver delightful search experiences through a unified,
platform that combines database, full-text search, and sync mechanism, providing
the fastest and easiest way to build search capabilities into applications.

## Search Index

Tigris organizes documents into a search index that is a data structure optimized
for providing full-text search capabilities. Tigris offers simple and intuitive
APIs for storing, reading and searching JSON documents from the search index.

## Getting Started

We have a ready to use template project that demonstrates implementing a
**Search REST API** using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and
[Tigris TypeScript SDK](https://docs.tigrisdata.com/typescript/).

Follow the following steps to get started with it.

### Prerequisites

<Installation />

### Create a project {#create-project}

Once you have successfully signed up, you are ready to start creating a project.
You can create a new project from the Tigris Cloud dashboard by clicking on the
**Create a new project** button from the <a href={tigrisConfig.consoleUrl}>Tigris Cloud dashboard</a>.

### Run the `create-tigris-app` command

As part of project creation, Tigris will generate the credentials
(`Client ID` and `Client Secret`) for use with your application. You can fetch
the credentials from the Application Keys page. These credentials and the
name of the project that you specified in the previous step will be required
by the `create-tigris-app` command.

Run the `create-tigris-app` command as follows:

```shell
npx create-tigris-app@latest --example rest-search-express
```

The above command will also take care of installing the dependencies.

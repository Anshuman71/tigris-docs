# Using Interfaces

We recommend using [Classes and Decorators](datamodel.mdx) to define the data model.
However, if you prefer to not use class decorators you can define the collection schema using Interfaces.
This section describes how to define the data model using Interfaces.

:::note
You do not need to have all the fields present in your document, defined in the
search model, only the fields that you need to be searchable. When you store
documents in the search index, we store the entire document including the fields
that are not defined in the search model
:::

## Declaring Models

Below we describe how the search models can be defined.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{interfaceIndexSchema}</CodeBlock>

Along with defining the interface for the search model, you will also need to
define the TigrisIndexSchema definition for the interface. There are additional
properties that can be specified to control how the fields in the search model
are indexed.

| Option      | Type    | Default | Usage                                                                             |
| ----------- | ------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| searchIndex | boolean | True    | To enable/disable indexing on a field. Any non-indexed field won't be searchable. |
| sort        | boolean | False   | To enable/disable sorting on a field.                                             |
| facet       | boolean | False   | To enable/disable faceting on a field.                                            |

```ts
// data container
interface Catalog extends TigrisIndexType {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  brand: string;
}

// schema definition
const catalogSchema: TigrisIndexSchema<Catalog> = {
  name: {
    type: TigrisDataTypes.STRING,
  },
  number: {
    type: TigrisDataTypes.NUMBER,
    sort: true,
  },
  brand: {
    types: TigrisDataTypes.STRING,
    facet: true,
  },
};
```

:::info
Make sure you always keep the search model interface and the TigrisIndexSchema
definition in sync.

## Indexing Embedded Documents

Tigris supports rich document structures. For example, you can embed related
data in a single document. Embedded models allow application to fetch data with
fewer queries, thus reducing query activity and increasing efficiency.

Below is an example of embedded model. We first define the `ProductItem` type
and then embed it inside the `Order` type.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{embeddedWithInterface}</CodeBlock>

## Arrays in documents

Including arrays in your schema requires `items` attribute to identify its contents.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{arrayWithInterface}</CodeBlock>

### Array of array(s)

Following example demonstrates a search model with nested arrays:

<CodeBlock language="ts">{nestedArrayWithInterface}</CodeBlock>

## Create a Search Index

Tigris provides an easy to use way to create or modify search indexes.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{createWithInterface}</CodeBlock>

## `id` field in a document {#id-field}

Every indexed document in Tigris has an `id` field of `string` type to uniquely
identify it. The `id` can be used to get, replace or delete a document in search
index. `id` is immutable.

Tigris assigns an auto-generated `id` to each document. However, there might be
cases where you want to supply your own ID, for example to avoid duplicate
documents to be indexed. In such cases you can specify an `id` field in the schema.

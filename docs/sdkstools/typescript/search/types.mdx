# Field Types

Tigris supports the majority of the primitive TypeScript types while also
providing support for custom types.

- primitive types: `string`, `boolean`, `number`, `bigint`, `Date`, `object`.
- Custom types: user-defined class to define custom types.
- Array and object of all of above is supported.

## Working with 64-bit integers (BigInt) {#bigint}

Javascript [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/references/Global_Objects/Number) type
can only represent integer values from `-9007199254740991` to `9007199254740991`. If your Search Index
field has a use-case for 64-bit integers, we recommend using `bigint` or `string` field type to represent
your integers.

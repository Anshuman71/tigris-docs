# Field Types

Tigris supports the majority of the primitive TypeScript types while also
providing support for custom types.

| Type    | Sort | Facet |
| ------- | ---- | ----- |
| string  | yes  | yes   |
| boolean | yes  | yes   |
| number  | yes  | yes   |
| bigint  | yes  | yes   |
| date    | yes  | no    |
| object  | yes  | yes   |
| array   | no   | yes   |

:::note

In case of an object type field, `sort` and `facet` properties apply to its nested fields. The above rules also apply to user-defined class.

## Working with 64-bit integers (BigInt) {#bigint}

Javascript [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/references/Global_Objects/Number) type
can only represent integer values from `-9007199254740991` to `9007199254740991`. If your Search Index
field has a use-case for 64-bit integers, we recommend using `bigint` or `string` field type to represent
your integers.

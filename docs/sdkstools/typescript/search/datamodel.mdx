# Search Modeling

The first step is to define search models as part of your application code. The
data conforming to these models is stored as JSON documents and indexed in Tigris
to facilitate searches.

:::note
You do not need to have all the fields present in your document, defined in the
search model, only the fields that you need to be searchable. When you store
documents in the search index, we store the entire document including the fields
that are not defined in the search model
:::

## Declaring Models

With the Tigris TypeScript client you can define your data models using
**Decorated classes** or **Interfaces**. The use of Decorators is recommended and is covered in this section.
If you prefer to use Interfaces, you can refer to the [Interfaces](../using-interfaces) section.

Below we describe how the search models can be defined.

Tigris client uses `@TigrisSearchIndex("search-index-name")` decorator on a class
to identify a schema (search model) for the index. Requires a `string`
input as the name of this search index.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{decoratorIndexSchema}</CodeBlock>

For the properties in the class to be made searchable, they need to be annotated
with the `@SearchField()` annotation. The data type is determined using
"reflection" if the optional `type` parameter is not specified. A `@SearchField()`
decorator accepts optional parameters to further refine how the document field is indexed.

| Option      | Type            | Default                    | Usage                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | --------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| searchIndex | boolean         | True                       | To enable/disable indexing on a field. Any non-indexed field won't be searchable.                       |
| sort        | boolean         | False                      | To enable/disable sorting on a field. Not supported for Arrays and Objects without a predefined schema. |
| facet       | boolean         | False                      | To enable/disable faceting on a field. Not supported for Array of Objects.                              |
| dimensions  | number          | Required for vector fields | The number of dimensions of the vector embeddings that will be stored.                                  |
| elements    | TigrisDataTypes | Required for Array fields  | The type of the elements in the array.                                                                  |

```ts
@TigrisSearchIndex("catalog")
export class Catalog {
  @SearchField({ sort: true })
  name: string;

  @SearchField({ sort: true })
  price: number;

  @SearchField({ facet: true })
  brand: string;

  @SearchField({ elements: TigrisDataTypes.STRING, facet: true })
  @Field({ elements: TigrisDataTypes.STRING })
  tags: Array<string>;

  @SearchField({ dimensions: 1536 })
  vector: number[];
}
```

:::info
Documents that you store in a search index can have fields that are not annotated
with `@SearchField()`. These fields are not searchable. A common use-case is
where you have a document with ten fields and you only want five of the fields
to be searchable but would like to store the entire document.

Additionally, it is possible to turn sorting or faceting on or off for the model
in the search index at any time without the need to drop the index.

The [Tigris TypeScript client repository](https://github.com/tigrisdata/tigris-client-ts/tree/main/src/__tests__/fixtures/schema/search)
has more examples for defining complex schemas.

## Storing Vector Embeddings

An embedding is a vector representation of a document. Embeddings are
generated by a machine learning model. The vector representation is a
dense vector of floating-point numbers that can be used to find similar documents.

To store vector embeddings in Tigris, you need to define a field as follows:

```ts
@SearchField({ dimensions: 1536 })
vector: number[];
```

## Indexing Embedded Documents

Tigris supports rich document structures. For example, you can embed related
data in a single document. Embedded models allow application to fetch data with
fewer queries, thus reducing query activity and increasing efficiency.

Below is an example of embedded model. We first define the `ProductItem` type
and then embed it inside the `Order` type.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{embeddedWithDecorator}</CodeBlock>

## Arrays in documents

Including arrays in your schema requires `elements` option to identify type of elements when using
`@SearchField()` decorator.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{arrayWithDecorator}</CodeBlock>

## Create a Search Index

Tigris provides an easy to use way to create or modify search indexes.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{createWithDecorator}</CodeBlock>

## `id` field in a document {#id-field}

Every indexed document in Tigris has an `id` field of `string` type to uniquely
identify it. The `id` can be used to get, replace or delete a document in search
index. `id` is immutable.

Tigris assigns an auto-generated `id` to each document. However, there might be
cases where you want to supply your own ID, for example to avoid duplicate
documents to be indexed. In such cases you can specify an `id` field in the schema.

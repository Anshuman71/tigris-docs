title: Data access using iterator
---

Query operations that fetch multiple documents from server do not immediately return all values.
The query can potentially match large sets of documents, and may need to be fetched in batches to
optimize network and memory usage. These queries return an object `Iterator` that facilitates data
consumption.

Iterator instance returned by the query APIs, should not be used concurrently.

Following are a few ways to access data from an iterator:

## Streaming

Streaming methods can be used to retrieve large results, so as they are not loading entire dataset in memory.

### Using Next method

Next iteration pattern is the most flexible one.
It allows to:

- Partially consume the stream
- Pause iteration while keeping the iterator open \* Reschedule on other goroutine and resume iteration

```go
it, err := catalogs.Read(ctx,
    filter.And(
        filter.Lt("Price", 50),
        filter.Gte("Popularity", 8),
    ),
)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
defer it.Close()

var product Catalog
for it.Next(&product) {
    fmt.Printf("%+v\n", product)
}

if it.Err() != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

### Using closure

Closure has an advantage over the Next method, so as iterator is closed automatically.
But entire stream should be consumed at once. Returning an error from the closure stops the iteration
prematurely.

```go
it, err := catalogs.Read(ctx,
    filter.And(
        filter.Lt("Price", 50),
        filter.Gte("Popularity", 8),
    ),
)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

err = it.Iterate(func(p *Catalog) error {
    fmt.Printf("%+v\n", p)
	return nil
})
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

## Array of documents

An array of documents can be requested from Iterator using `Array()` method, this
would entail reading all documents from database matching the query and returning it as an Array.

```go
it, err := catalogs.Read(ctx, filter.Eq("brand", "Adidas"))
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

arr, err := it.Array()
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

for k, v := range arr {
	fmt.Printf("%v=%+v\n", k, v)
}
```

:::caution
If a query matches large number of documents, the internal memory may not be enough to store the
Array. In such cases, `Array()` can cause performance issues or failures if dataset exceeds memory
constraints. It is recommended to use one of the iteration or streaming methods to read documents.

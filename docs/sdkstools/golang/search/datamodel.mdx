# Search Modeling

The first step is to define search models as part of your application code. The
data conforming to these models is stored as JSON documents and indexed in Tigris
to facilitate searches.

:::note
You do not need to have all the fields present in your document, defined in the
search model, only the fields that you need to be searchable. When you store
documents in the search index, we store the entire document including the fields
that are not defined in the search model
:::

## Declaring Models

Below we describe how the search models can be defined.

Declaring a model is as simple as defining Go struct type in the code.
Defining search index data models is no different from defining regular collection data model.

<CodeBlock language="go">{indexSchema}</CodeBlock>

By default, all fields in the search index are indexes. No explicit `tigris:"searchIndex"` annotation required
as it would be for regular collection. The following optional annotation can be explicitly used to refine how
the document field is indexed.

| Option | Type    | Default | Usage                                                                                                   |
| ------ | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| sort   | boolean | False   | To enable/disable sorting on a field. Not supported for Arrays and Objects without a predefined schema. |
| facet  | boolean | False   | To enable/disable faceting on a field. Not supported for Array of Objects.                              |

:::info
Documents that you store in a search index can have `tigris:"searchIndex:false"` annotation.
These fields are not searchable. A common use-case is
where you have a document with ten fields and you only want five of the fields
to be searchable but would like to store the entire document.

Additionally, it is possible to turn sorting or faceting on or off for the model
in the search index at any time without the need to drop the index.

## Indexing Embedded Documents

Tigris supports rich document structures. For example, you can embed related
data in a single document. Embedded models allow application to fetch data with
fewer queries, thus reducing query activity and increasing efficiency.

Below is an example of embedded model. We first define the `ProductItem` type
and then embed it inside the `Order` type.

<CodeBlock language="go">{embeddedSchema}</CodeBlock>

## Vector Field

Tigris supports vector fields. Vector fields are used to store the vector
embeddings of the documents. These embeddings are used to perform vector search.

```go
type CatalogDetail struct {
	Id    int `tigris:"primaryKey,autoGenerate"`
	Spec  string
	Description string
	VecField [1536]float64 `json:"vec_field" tigris:"vector"`
}
```

## Arrays in documents

Arrays are defined as usual no additional annotations required.

<CodeBlock language="go">{arraySchema}</CodeBlock>

same with multidimensional arrays

<CodeBlock language="go">{nestedArraySchema}</CodeBlock>

## Create a Search Index

Tigris provides an easy to use way to create or modify search indexes.

<CodeBlock language="go">{createIndex}</CodeBlock>

## `id` field in a document {#id-field}

Every indexed document in Tigris has an `id` field of `string` type to uniquely
identify it. The `id` can be used to get, replace or delete a document in search
index. `id` is immutable.

Tigris assigns an auto-generated `id` to each document. However, there might be
cases where you want to supply your own ID, for example to avoid duplicate
documents to be indexed. In such cases you can specify an `id` field in the schema.

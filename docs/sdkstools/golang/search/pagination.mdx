# Pagination

Pagination is commonly used by applications to consume large amount of data by
dividing it into small pages. Modern applications leverage one of the
following commonly used UX patterns:

- **Traditional pagination using page numbers** - Users can visit next or previous page of results
  or jump an arbitraty page by choosing page numbers. The main benefit to a user is a visibility into
  number of pages and ability to jump to an arbitrary page number.

- **Infinite scrolling** - When a website returns only a part of the results. But as the users
  scroll down to the end of the page, additional results are loaded and rendered for the users.
  This allows users to browse as many results they want without having to click anything, which is
  friendlier to mobile device users.

## Paginating through search results

In this section we'll see the constructs provided by our SDK that assist
developers in building out pagination into their apps. Considering the
[search example](../search#example) let's work through the search index:

<CodeBlock language="go">{getSearchIndex}</CodeBlock>

### Using page numbers {#using-page-number}

To retrieve a page of results, you can simply use `Search` method with page number and
page size. Following query fetches the first page of results with page size set as **5**

<CodeBlock language="go">{searchPaginationPageNumber}</CodeBlock>
<Details language="go">
  <summary>Output</summary>
  <CodeBlock>{searchPaginationPageNumberOutput}</CodeBlock>
</Details>

The `PageSize` parameter controls the number of documents to include in a result page. The returned
array of documents is accessible under `Hits` key along with some search metadata.

Additionally, search result contains `Meta` object having current page and total pages along with
other information.

<CodeBlock language="go">{searchPaginationMeta}</CodeBlock>
<Details language="go">
  <summary>Output</summary>
  <CodeBlock>{searchPaginationMetaOutput}</CodeBlock>
</Details>

### Infinite scrolling

Infinite scrolling also loads data in pages, it is just that the UX is more fluid.
Instead of using page number, an Iterator object can be obtained from `Search()`
method call and processed iteratively.

<CodeBlock language="go">{searchPaginationInfiniteScrolling}</CodeBlock>
<Details language="go">
  <summary>Output</summary>
  <CodeBlock>{searchPaginationInfiniteScrollingOutput}</CodeBlock>
</Details>

As you can see, the iterator returns the same `search.Result` object as in [previous section](#using-page-number)
with pagination metadata.

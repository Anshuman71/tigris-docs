# Search Documents

Tigris offers easy to use constructs for building complex search queries. In
this section we will take a look at the sample data in the example below and
walk through a few scenarios to search for documents.

### Example

Let's say we have a Search Index `catalog` with following documents:

| id  | name           | price | brand        | labels   | popularity | review                              |
| --- | -------------- | ----- | ------------ | -------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1   | fiona handbag  | 99.9  | michael kors | purses   | 8          | {"author": "alice", "rating": 7}    |
| 2   | tote bag       | 49    | coach        | handbags | 9          | {"author": "olivia", "rating": 8.3} |
| 3   | sling bag      | 75    | coach        | purses   | 9          | {"author": "alice", "rating": 9.2}  |
| 4   | sneakers shoes | 40    | adidas       | shoes    | 10         | {"author": "olivia", "rating": 9}   |
| 5   | running shoes  | 89    | nike         | shoes    | 10         | {"author": "olivia", "rating": 8.5} |
| 6   | running shorts | 35    | adidas       | clothing | 7          | {"author": "olivia", "rating": 7.5} |

### Get Search Index instance

The first step is to get an instance of the search index.

<CodeBlock language="ts">{getSearchIndex}</CodeBlock>

## Searching for documents

Search consists of executing a query against one or more text fields. Let's perform a simple search query to
lookup any items matching "running".

```golang
it, err := catalog.Search(ctx, &search.Request{
	Q: "running",
})
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

var res search.Result[model.Catalog]
for it.Next(&res) {
	for _, v := range res.Hits {
		fmt.Printf("%+v\n", v.Document)
	}
	fmt.Printf("%+v\n", res.Meta)
}

if it.Err() != nil {
	panic(it.Err())
}
```

:::info
Search is **case-insensitive**, i.e., a search for term `"ruNninG"` would
match all of `["Running", "running", "RUnnIng", "RUNNING"]` etc.
:::

### Phrase search

By default, search is performed over individual terms in the text. For example,
searching for a query string `adventure park` in a dataset would yield
following results:

1. "California's kids **adventure park** and Safari"
2. "**Adventure** island and water **park**"
3. "Long Island water **park** and **adventure** activities"
4. "Six flags kids recreation and **adventure park**"
5. "Hollywood **adventure park** and studios"
6. "Seaworld **adventure** and theme **park**"

The search phrase can be _escaped_ in query for exact match. In the above example, querying for exact
phrase `\"adventure park\"` would return:

1. "California's kids **adventure park** and Safari"
2. "Six flags kids recreation and **adventure park**"
3. "The Great America **adventure park** and Zoo"

Phrases can still be combined with keywords for richer text search. Continuing above example,
the query string `kids \"adventure park\"` would result in:

1. "California's **kids adventure park** and Safari"
2. "Six flags **kids** recreation and **adventure park**"

```golang
it, err := catalog.Search(ctx, &search.Request{
	Q: `"adventure park"`,
})

it, err := catalog.Search(ctx, &search.Request{
	Q: `Kids "adventure park"`,
})
```

### Match all search query

When a query string isn't specified or an empty string (`""`) is specified, a
match all query is performed. It returns all searchable documents, filtered by
any filters specified.

```golang
it, err := catalog.Search(ctx, &search.Request{
	Q: "",
})
```

:::tip
Fetching all documents is typically useful only when used in conjunction with
**filters**, or when performing a **faceted search** across the search index.
:::

## Searching on specific fields

We can optionally perform the search on specific fields. This is done by
projecting the search query against these fields. Continuing previous example of
searching for "running", we may not want to search for it in the `review` field.
This can be accomplished by restricting the `searchFields` in the query as
shown below:

```golang
it, err := catalog.Search(ctx, &search.Request{
	Q:            "running",
	SearchFields: []string{"name", "category"},
})
```

## Refine the search results using filters {#filters}

### Applying a simple filter on search results

Let's adjust the query to only return items where `brand` is **nike**:

```golang
it, err := catalog.Search(ctx, &search.Request{
	Q:            "running",
	SearchFields: []string{"name", "category"},
	Filter:       filter.Eq("brand", "nike"),
})
```

### Applying complex filter on search results

Let's adjust the query to only return items in `price` range of **[40, 90)**:

```golang
it, err := catalog.Search(ctx, &search.Request{
	Q:            "running",
	SearchFields: []string{"name", "category"},
	Filter: filter.And(
		filter.Gte("price", 40),
		filter.Lt("price", 90),
	),
})
```

## Faceted search {#facets}

We can additionally retrieve the stats on one or more fields from the search results.
For example, if we wanted to retrieve the stats for the search results around
number of items by `brand` and unique `labels`, we can add faceting to the query
as shown below:

```golang
it, err := catalog.Search(ctx, &search.Request{
	Q:            "running",
	SearchFields: []string{"name", "labels"},
	Facet: &search.FacetQuery{
		FacetFields: map[string]search.FacetQueryOptions{
			"popularity": {Size: 10},
		},
	},
})
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

var res search.Result[model.Catalog]
for it.Next(&res) {
	f := res.Facets["popularity"]

	fmt.Printf("%+v\n", f.Counts)
	fmt.Printf("Max: %+v Min: %+v Avg: %+v Count: %+v\n",
		*f.Stats.Max, *f.Stats.Min, *f.Stats.Avg, f.Stats.Count)
}
if it.Err() != nil {
	panic(it.Err())
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Output</summary>

```
[{Count:1 Value:7} {Count:1 Value:10}]
Max: 10 Min: 7 Avg: 8.5 Count: 2
```

</details>

## Sorting the search results

Tigris lets you specify an order to sort the search results. We can specify a ranking order in our
search query to have results sorted with more popular items appearing first.

```golang
order := sort.NewSortOrder(sort.Descending("popularity"))
it, err := catalog.Search(ctx, &search.Request{
	Q:            "running",
	SearchFields: []string{"name", "labels"},
	Sort:         &order,
})
```

We can also sort by multiple fields. In the example below, the search results
are sorted by the first field `popularity`, where there are documents that have
the same `popularity` score, they are further sorted by the field `review.rating`:

```golang
order := sort.NewSortOrder(
	sort.Descending("popularity"),
	sort.Descending("review.rating"),
)

it, err := catalog.Search(ctx, &search.Request{
	Q:            "running",
	SearchFields: []string{"name", "labels"},
	Sort:         &order,
})
```

<details>
  <summary>Output</summary>

```
&{Brand:nike Id:1aeb7c50-201d-42e8-8b77-23f3a3b86a89 Labels:shoes Name:running shoes Popularity:10 Price:89 Review:{Author:olivia Rating:8.5}}
&{Brand:adidas Id:a3e3c779-31cb-4d60-87cb-c4edc64ab4b7 Labels:clothing Name:running shorts Popularity:7 Price:35 Review:{Author:olivia Rating:7.5}}
```

</details>

The results will be first sorted by value of `popularity` field, `review.rating` will be used to
decide ordering if two matching documents have same `popularity`.

:::note
Documents can be sorted by `int32/int64`, `float64`, `string` and `time.Time` fields.
Sorting by nested fields is also allowed.
:::

## Specifying document fields to retrieve

Search query can be programmed to return only specific fields in a document in
search results. For example, if we only need to retrieve product `name`, `brand`
and `price` we can specify the `includeFields` option as follows:

```golang
it, err := catalog.Search(ctx, &search.Request{
	Q:             "running",
	IncludeFields: []string{"name", "brand"},
})
```

<details>
  <summary>Output</summary>

```
&{Brand:nike Id:<nil> Labels: Name:running shoes Popularity:0 Price:0 Review:{Author: Rating:0}}
&{Brand:adidas Id:<nil> Labels: Name:running shorts Popularity:0 Price:0 Review:{Author: Rating:0}}
```

</details>

Optionally, we can exclude fields from search results. This might be useful
to exclude/hide potentially sensitive fields. For example, to include all fields
except `id` and `review.rating` in search results:

```golang
it, err := catalog.Search(ctx, &search.Request{
    Q:             "running",
        ExcludeFields: []string{"id", "review.rating"},
})
```

:::note
Field selection does not impact searching, filtering and faceting capabilities for that field. For
example, if `review` field is not included in documents in search results, it could still be used
for text querying, filtering and/or faceting; just that matched documents in
the search results won't include `review` field.
:::

## Case Insensitive Search Result Filtering

Search is **case-insensitive** but the [filters](#filters) used for filtering
the search results are **case-sensitive** by default.

Tigris provides `Collation` support which allows you to specify string
comparison rules for filtering on text fields. Set the case to `ci` in the
collation object to make it **case-insensitive**.

The following example demonstrates using case-insensitive filters when
performing a search query:

```golang
it, err := catalog.Search(ctx, &search.Request{
	Q:            "running",
	SearchFields: []string{"name", "labels"},
	Options: &search.Options{Collation: &driver.Collation{Case: "ci"}},
})
```

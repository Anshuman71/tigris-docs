# Using mongosh with Tigris

[`mongosh`](https://github.com/mongodb-js/mongosh) is the MongoDB Shell. It is
a fully functional JavaScript and Node.js 16.x REPL environment for interacting
with MongoDB >= 4.0 compatible deployments.

### Connect to Tigris

Create a Project in Tigris and take a note of _Project Name_, application key
_Client ID_, and _Client Secret_.

We will use the _Client ID_ and _Client Secret_ from the output of the command
above as the `username` and `password` in our MongoDB URI. We will use
`m1k.preview.tigrisdata.cloud` as the deployment to connect to.

```shell
mongosh mongodb://{TIGRIS_CLIENT_ID}:{TIGRIS_CLIENT_SECRET}@m1k.preview.tigrisdata.cloud:27018/?authMechanism=PLAIN --quiet --tls
```

You will see output similar to the following:

```text
test>
```

:::info

Note how you did not have to create a MongoDB Atlas cluster.
`m1k.preview.tigrisdata.cloud` is a serverless deployment with builtin
automatic database sharding, meaning that, unlike MongoDB Atlas, you never have to
worry about sharding or shard keys, and the data distribution is
automatically handled.

### Connect to the database

Assuming the name of the Tigris project you chose in the
[connect to Tigris](#connect-to-tigris) step above is `mongosh_quickstart`, a
database with that name would have been automatically created. Let's switch to
this database.

```shell
use mongosh_quickstart
```

You will see output similar to following:

```text
test> use mongosh_quickstart
switched to db mongosh_quickstart
```

### Create a collection and insert a document

Let's create the collection `podcasts` and insert a document

```shell
db.podcasts.insertOne({
  title: 'The Polyglot Developer Podcast',
  author: 'Nic Raboy',
  tags: [ 'development', 'programming', 'coding' ]
})
```

This results in the following output:

```text
mongosh_quickstart> db.podcasts.insertOne({ title: 'The Polyglot Developer Podcast', author: 'Nic Raboy', tags: [ 'development', 'programming', 'coding' ] })
{
  acknowledged: true,
  insertedId: ObjectId("63f8340c6fdb0db31a94bcbf")
}
```

We can see that the collection is created:

```shell
mongosh_quickstart> show collections
podcasts
```

### Read all documents in the collection

Let's now read the data in the collection:

```shell
db.podcasts.find()
```

This returns all the documents in the collection `podcasts`:

```text
mongosh_quickstart> db.podcasts.find()
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId("63f8340c6fdb0db31a94bcbf"),
    title: 'The Polyglot Developer Podcast',
    author: 'Nic Raboy',
    tags: [ 'development', 'programming', 'coding' ]
  }
]
```

And that's all. Feel free to explore Deletes and Updates similarly.

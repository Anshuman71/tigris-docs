# Deploying to Netlify

In this guide, we will deploy a to-do app built with Next.js and Tigris to Netlfiy.

## Prerequisites

- Github account, ([signup](https://github.com) for a free account if you
  don't have one.)

## Setup

- Login to [Tigris console](https://console.preview.tigrisdata.cloud) and

  In the next step, we will use the generated `Client ID` and `Client Secret`
  as Environment Variables when deploying our Next.js app on Netlify.

  Netlify setup the site, custom domain and HTTPS for your site.

# Using Tigris with your Next.js project

Tigris is a Serverless NoSQL Database and Search Platform that allows you to rapidly
build dynamic data-driven Next.js applications without having to deal with the
complexity of managing infrastructure.

This guide demonstrates using the create-tigris-app CLI to create a Next.js project that uses Tigris as the database.
If you want to instead use the create-next-app CLI, see the
[How to create a new Next.js project with Tigris using create-next-app](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/create-next-app-with-tigris/) blog.

### Getting started

<Installation />

### Create Tigris Project

Once you have signup into the Tigris console, click on the `Create a new project`
button to create a new project from your

<a href={tigrisConfig.consoleUrl}>Tigris Cloud dashboard</a>.

Enter `todo` as your project name and click on the `Create` button. Tigris will generate the Cloud credentials for your application. You will also be shown a command to create your application using the credentials.

Every Tigris project comes with a pre-configured database.

### Create your Next.js project

To create your Next.js project, copy the `create-tigris-app` command generated in your Tigris console.

This will prompt you to pick the template for your project, select the `nextjs-api-routes` template, and click enter.

### Run

Run the app and see it automatically create your collections.

```shell
cd todo
npm run dev
```

:tada: Your full-stack web app is ready and accessible on `localhost:3000` in the browser.

Now, if you go back to your Tigris console, you will see the collections created for the project.

# Using Tigris with Next.js

Tigris is the scalable real-time backend for Next.js applications. Build
data-rich features, seamlessly implement search, and easily connect
serverless functions.

### Getting started

<Installation />

### Create Tigris Project

Once you have signup into the Tigris console, click on the `Create a new project` button to create a new project from your Tigris Cloud dashboard.

Enter `todo` as your project name and click on the `Create` button. Tigris will generate the Cloud credentials for your application. You will also be shown a command to create your application using the credentials.

Every Tigris project comes with a pre-configured database.

### Scaffold your Next.js app

To scaffold your application, copy the `create-tigris-app` command generated in your Tigris console.

This will prompt you to pick the template for your project, select the `nextjs-api-routes` template, and click enter.

### Run

Run the app and see it automatically create your collections.

```shell
cd todo
npm run dev
```

:tada: Your full-stack web app is ready and accessible on `localhost:3000` in the browser.

Now, if you go back to your Tigris console, you will see the collections created for the project.

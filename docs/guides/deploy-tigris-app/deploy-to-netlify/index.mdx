# Deploying to Netlify

In this guide, we will demonstrate how easy it is to deploy an app built with Next.js and Tigris to Netlify.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account, ([signup](https://github.com) for a free account if you
  don't have one.)

- Netlify account, ([signup](https://netlify.com) for a free account if you
  don't have one.)

- Tigris account, (<a href={tigrisConfig.signupUrl}>signup</a>) for a
  free account if you don't have one.)

## Setup

- Login to the <a href={tigrisConfig.loginUrl}>Tigris console</a> and
  follow the video instruction to
  register a new application under `My Settings` > `Application Keys`.
  In the next step, we will use the generated `Client ID` and `Client Secret`
  as Environment Variables when deploying our Next.js app on Netlify.

(note: these parameters will be saved under your site's environment
variables - you can view them on Netlify at `Site Settings` -> `Environment variables`)

- Click on `Save and deploy`
- It will start deployment on Netlify. It may take 1-3 minutes while
  Netlify sets up the site, custom domain and HTTPS for your site.
- Once setup, Netlify will generate URL for your website (if not using
  custom domain) and your Tigris + Next.js site is live on Netlify.

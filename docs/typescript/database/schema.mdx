# Schema

A schema defines all the fields that make up the document in a collection. All documents stored in a
collection must conform to the collection's schema.

## Schema Validation

The validation happens during the inserts or updates to the collection. The validation performed like this:

<li>Newly inserted documents are checked for validation.</li>
<li>
  During update, the new fields values are checked for the validation. As during
  insertion we are validating the document so we only need to validate the
  input.
</li>

## Modifying Schema

Tigris provides a lightweight way to modify the schema. Within Tigris, the
schema change is a metadata operation and hence doesn't require rebuilding
the entire collection. The updated schema is made available immediately to
new write operations.

However, there are certain restrictions on the type of modifications allowed.
These restrictions are in place to ensure that we don't need to rebuild
collections on schema changes.

### Allowed modifications

The following schema changes are currently supported:

- Adding a new field to an existing collection
- Defining a maximum length constraint on existing string or byte type
  fields. The constraint will only apply to documents added after the
  constraint is defined
- Increasing the maximum length constraint on existing string or byte type
  fields.

### Unsupported modifications

The following schema changes are currently not supported:

- Changing the data type of a field
- Removing a field from the schema
- Adding or removing a field from the primary key definition

### How to modify the schema

Suppose you have the following data model defined:

<TSDataModels
  decoratorExample={decoratorCollectionSource}
  interfaceExample={interfaceCollectionSource}
/>

And you would like to modify the model and add a new field `brand` of type
`string`. The steps to make this change are as follows:

#### Step 1: Update the data model in your application code

<DataModels
  codeLang="diff"
  decoratorExample={decoratorDiffSource}
  interfaceExample={interfaceDiffSource}
/>

#### Step 2: Update the Collection

Updates the collection with the new model and any new operation will see the changes.

<TSDataModels
  decoratorExample={decoratorCreateSource}
  interfaceExample={interfaceCreateSource}
/>
